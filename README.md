📝 Executive Summary
This project involves a comprehensive end-to-end analysis of a large-scale dataset containing 400,000+ individual records. The goal was to identify hidden patterns and trends that are often lost in smaller samples, providing a statistically significant foundation for [mention your goal, e.g., market forecasting / user behavior / operational efficiency].

🛠 The "Big Data" Challenge
Processing 400k rows requires more than just standard cleaning. This project showcases:

Memory Optimization: Utilized efficient data types and chunking methods in Python (Pandas) to handle the 400,000-row load without system lag.

Data Integrity: Implemented automated scripts to detect and resolve outliers and missing values across nearly half a million data points.

Performance SQL: (If applicable) Optimized complex queries with indexing to ensure sub-second retrieval times from the database.

📊 Key Technical Highlights
Scale: 400,000+ Observations | [X] Features/Columns.

Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL, Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.

Technique: [e.g., Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Regression Modeling, or Time-Series Forecasting].
